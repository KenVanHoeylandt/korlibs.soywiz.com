## Welcome to KorGE

Korge is a multiplatform game development toolset.

Getting started with KorGE is really simple:

1. [Setup the KorGE tooling](setup), based on IntelliJ plugin.

2. Take your [first steps](firststeps) learning to create a sample game with basic shapes.

3. Then build a more complex and realistic game with a [step-by-step tutorial to build a 2048 game](firstgame).

4. Finally, [deploy it in one of our supported platforms](/korge/deployment).

From there you can get a deep look to the [reference documentation](/korge/reference),
and have a look at the [samples](/korge/samples) to see how others have built
games and learn from them.
